          <h3><b>Being in a virtual Hackaton</b></h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.innodays.org/" target="_blank"><b>InnoDays</b></a>, along with co-organizers from the Berkeley Energy & Resources Collaborative (BERC) and sponsored by the EDF Innovation Lab, hosted its first-ever virtual hackathon
            from 9th-11th/April 2020. During 48 hours, InnoDays brought together companies, designers, engineers and entrepreneurial students to turn ideas into prototypes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I have never participated in a hackathon before, I decided to join and embrace working together to tackle challenges in social equity through micromobility.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge <a href="https://www.innodays.org/challenge/micromobility-socialequity" target="_blank"><b>question</b></a> was <b>"How might we design more inclusive Light Electric Vehicle form factors and micromobility solutions for both
              passenger mobility and goods delivery?"</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            All participants were allocated in teams attending their time's zones and mentors supported the journey from ideation to prototype. It was a very exciting collaboration with people from different professional backgrounds and from all over
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience has opened my mind to think more inclusively and globally about a problem, while considering different approaches, such as business and entrepreneurial perspectives. Additionally, I was able to try different digital tools,
            like <a href="https://sprintbase.io/" target="_blank"><b>Sprintbase</b></a> and <a href="https://airtable.com/" target="_blank"><b>Airtable</b></a> and quickly test and think possibilities beyond physical barriers.

          <h3><b>Starting a community</b></h3>
          <p>
            While as a Co-Founder of a meetup in London, being able to meet so many designers and other people involved in these events, I realized about the power of a community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The meetings helped so many people getting their first steps into UX Design/UI Design/Web Development. Not only by creating insights into the design thinking process but as well through portfolio feedback, overcome impostor syndrome,
            manage discussions into
            specific problems aiming to find solutions and support and encouragement through the job hunting process and while being in the job.

          <h3><b>Volunteering with Tech Circus (London)</b></h3>
          <p>
            I love <a href="https://techcircus.io" target="_blank"><b>Tech Circus</b></a> meetups - UX Crunch (London, UK).
          </p>
          <p>
            The team behind the scenes are very open and genuinely care about all the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, I directly contacted Tech Circus to get involved in the UX Live 2019 event and they received me with open arms, as well my closer community. Was such a wonderful surprise!
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the start of an exciting experience of collaboration, close connections and network expansion while learning new skills and growing my career through educational content and in direct contact with more experienced designers.
