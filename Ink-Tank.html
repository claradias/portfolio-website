          <h2 class="center">About</h2>
          <p>
            Ink Tank is a responsive web application not only for people that want to get a tattoo and are looking for the right tattoo design and tattoo artist, but also for tattoo artists to show their portfolio; helping people to make
            well-informed decisions. Ink Tank offers a bespoken connection between people looking for a tattoo style and local tattoo artists based on that style.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Ink Tank is a project I completed as part of the UX Immersion course with Career Foundry (Aug 2018 – Mar 2019).
          </p>
          <p>
            My role was to research, design and test all UX related to the project. As a result, I have learned new softwares: Sketch and InVision; and how to present my UX process and design skills.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="center">The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            My goal was to enable Ink Tank users to find the right design and tattoo artist, because getting a tattoo is a personal and emotional experience that the users want to avoid regret in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will know this to be true when I see users frequently using the web-app, instead of other services and leaving positive feedback and recommendations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initial potential <b>Solutions</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide easy contact with tattoo artists for direct questions and building a more close relationship between artist-user;</li>
            <li>The user would be able to book video calls, first consultation appointments or live chats;</li>
            <li>Clear organisation of tattoo artists and their portfolio by: profile, style, health and safety protocols, ink brands, sustainable practice and location;</li>
            <li>Simple, intuitive and clean designed platform.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="center">The Growth of the Project</h2>
          <p>
            To find solutions, I decided to explore the subject and as well do market research aiming to gather information on the competition and understand the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            I performed analyse of direct competitors, such as InkHunter and Tattoodo. For these, I built a competitor profile, a competitor feature matrix, a SWOT Analysis and a UX Analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Key points</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The competitors are mainly focused in the tattoo culture and lifestyle;</li>
            <li>I believe that by facilitating the user to discover their favorite tattoo style within a personalise enjoyable search experience, I would be able to connect the user to the artist that resonates its visual aesthetics and
              emotional values in its own location.</li>
            <li>Combine the features that make the major competitor apps stand out and adding others: as book appointments, artists profile containing additional information: health and safety protocols, ink brands and sustainable practice.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="interviews">
          <h2 class="center">Interviews</h2>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/InkTank/interview/InkTank_Interviews_600.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/InkTank/interview/InkTank_Interviews_1200.jpg" alt="Interview image">
          </picture>
          <p>
            In order to gather qualitative data and gain insight from my potential users on how Ink Tank web app will be used, I carried out 3 interviews using a guerilla approach​​​​​​​. All interviews were recorded with participant consent. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The participants interviewed range from having tattoos and intend to continue going through the process of getting another tattoo; to don’t have tattoos, but would like to have one. All the participants never used a tattoo app, only word
            of
            mouth or research on facebook and instagram.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately during my interviews I was not able to interview any tattoo artist due to constant refusal of doing so; therefore, I was not able to build its persona or journey map.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interviews' results were organised utilizing an affinity mapping, in order to identify behaviours, goals and attitudes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Key points</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tattoos hold meaning;</li>
            <li>Users want to be able to personalize their tattoo: by editing and previewing their designs;</li>
            <li>Artists have clear information regarding their portfolio, reviews, testimonials and safety;</li>
            <li>The user can book appointments with the artist through the app;</li>
            <li>Good research is synonym of right tattoo design;</li>
            <li>Social media and word of mouth is the most common ways to make a decision on a tattoo design and tattoo artist.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="personas">
          <h2 class="center">Personas</h2>
          <p>
            I created 2 personas that embodied the traits of the targeted audience and helped me to understand our users, their goals and their frustrations. Having these personas also aided me in knowing what problems I was trying to solve.

            Once I had a better understanding of my personas, i created their individual journey maps. The intention was to empathise with their particular experience through hypothetical scenarios.

          <p>
            I conducted an open card sorting to better design the information architecture of Ink Tank web app. For this, I used OptimalSort to create a digital card sorting test to 5 participants that I then analysed and informed the creation of a
            new
            sitemap.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have tried to outline the hierarchy of the web app, along to the specific actions that users take to navigate and meet their goals. ​​​​​​​

        <div id="wireframes">
          <h2 class="center">Ideate</h2>
          <p>
            I created wireframes, ranging from sketches to high-fidelity, throughout the design process. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Iterations were made as necessary based on the user goals from the flows.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to choose a simple and clear design and a white colour background, so it would highlight the tattoo design images.
          </p>
          <p>
            The images below, from left to right, are progressive examples of my iterative process.

        <div id="testing">
          <h2 class="center">Usability Testing</h2>
          <p>
            I created a prototype in InVision to start testing the usefulness of the app and to determine the level of usability. Additionally, i also intended to identify areas of improvement, pain points and how easily the user is able to navigate
            the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Four participants were recruited via email and social media on my professional and social network. The usability test was conducted as moderated in-person and remote tests. The test included a short briefing, task performance with Ink
            Tank
            app in a mobile and follow up with any questions or comments.
          </p>
          <p>
            To interpret the information from the usability testing, I created an Affinity Map. The isolation of the information helped me to determine how it relates to each other and another, discovering unseen patterns and hierarchies.
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/InkTank/usabilitytesting/InkTank_UsabilityTesting_600.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/InkTank/usabilitytesting/InkTank_usabilityTesting_1200.jpg" alt="usability testing">
          </picture>
          <p>
            Afterwards, the information was processed using a Rainbow Spreadsheet that helped me to classify important observations and errors by presenting organised visual results (i.e. it creates visual patterns). 
          </p>
          <p>
            A severity errors rating scale from Jakob Nielsen was also applied aiming to categorise and rank the severity of errors.
             </p>
          <p>
            Overall, all the participants agreed that the app was easy to use giving scores between 5-9 for each task (according to Single Ease Question - satisfactory measurement scale). 
            <p>
              Issue severity scale: High, Medium and Low. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="problems">
          <h2 class="center">Specific Problems</h2>
          <p>
            One of the issues that came up during the tests was that, when a user was asked to contact the artist, they missed or couldn't find the option to select the contact button (1). The reason that this might happen is because the button is on
            the bottom of the page and some users need to scroll.
          </P>
          <p>
            This was solved by replacing contact button for the options follow, book appointment and message as icons and make them more visible by relocating them to the top of the artist profile page (2). ​​​​​​​
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/InkTank/specificproblems/InkTank_1problem_600.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

          </picture>
          <p>
            Another issue was that most of the users think that the icons "like" and "save" were confusing as they should be the same in their opinion (3). This has been solved by replacing the icon "save" to a button "Save as Favorite" (4), so users
            can save their tattoo design.
          </p>

            A round of preference test was also carried out on the introductory screen where i highlighted the start of onboarding. Ten participants took part in the testing.​​​​​​​

            <li>The participants feedback emphasised issues with the visual design, the mobile interactive elements and the completion of the tasks;</li>
            <li>The optimisation of these elements aims to meet my persona needs while increasing a usability of the app and user engagement;</li>
            <li>Majority of the participants preferred a more optional, clearer and more direct way of entering in the app.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I then made iterations and final fixes to the product towards improving my prototype based on the users and the research I conducted.

            <li>Im more knowledgeable of the tattoo culture and lifestyle, the use of tattoo apps and that tattoos are an emotional experience not just a ink drawing;</li>
            <li>It is important to not get lost into details too early;</li>
            <li>I would take in consideration much earlier accessibility guidelines into this design project;</li>
            <li>I gained valuable experience going through the usability testing;</li>
            <li>Iteration through continuous testing and peer feedback are the ways forward to improve design over time.</li>

        <div>
          <h2 class="center">Future Improvements:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Onboarding can be improved in regards to accessibility and simple explanation of how the app works</li>
            <li>As well the flow to follow a tattoo artist and where this information is located</li>
            <li>Accessibility still needs to be improved accross the app</li>
            <li>Create an account can be simplified by creating proximity between the social media icons and an email sign up input field</li>
            <li>Overall improvement of the UI elements to a clear and clean design</li>
