          <p>
            The project objective was to create the first B2C responsive platform (Website, Account creation and Dashboard) which allows people to calculate their wind farm ownership based on their electricity demand, choose an affordable tariff with Ripple's supply partners and cooperatively own a wind farm with other members.
          </p>
          <p>
            This also involved designing their MVP features, building the company Design System, deliver prototypes to show case features, user testing and overall optimization of the UX/UI design.

            <li>collect data from Google Analytics and Hotjar;</li>
            <li>conduct A/B tests and desirability testing with 5-7 participants for the website landing page.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We aimed to understand if the landing page was effectively communicating the intended message and improve the overall website usability, navigation and interaction, through capturing accurate data on user behaviours.

          <p>
            It was great to be able to be part of the beginning of this project. It was a complete design and built from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ripple Energy offers a unique product which on itself is very challenging. It was highly important to build a platform, as easy and pain-free as possible for the user whilst ensuring consistency across platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a very enriching experience to build the first Design System of the company. This aimed to ensure consistency for the evergrowing product and significantly improve the team's efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've learned a lot from this project by working alongside an experienced and diverse team. From establishing processes and ways of working, receiving feedback and making informed design decision to understand customer journeys that helped
            me to uncover new problems to solve and ultimately build a better product.
